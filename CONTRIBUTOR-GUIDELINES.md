The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repo on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Contributors


Hack Your Future would not exist without all of the volunteer contributions, big and little.  To make sure everyone gets the recognition they deserve we invite you to add anyone to this repository who you think deserves a little round of applause.

Contributions can be anything, even work that doesn't appear on GitHub.

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!

## Contributing workflow

Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to the `main` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
